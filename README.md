=========

This is a simple experiment I wanted to try and while I didn't go very far, it's pretty much working.

In order to run the project, you'll need to install pygame and pydot (which requires graphviz).
Once installed, run the project using `python main.py`.

The goal of the current experiment is to produce actors that will reach the white square, tend to have 3 vertices (triangle) and approach the color blue.
Between 10 or 30 generations, the 3 goals should have been reached.
You can skip to the next generation by pushing `n` or pause by pushing `p`.
